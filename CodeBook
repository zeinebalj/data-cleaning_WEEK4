Differents steps in analysis code 

Read dataset files from UCI HAR to given name and prefix. Know names are "train" and "test". Known prefixes are "X", "y" and "subject".

Examples:
UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt

Downloading and loading data

Downloads the UCI HAR zip file if it doesn't exist
Reads the activity labels to activityLabels
Reads the column names of data (a.k.a. features) to features
Reads the test data.frame to testData
Reads the trainning data.frame to trainningData

Manipulating data

Merges test data and trainning data to allData
Indentifies the mean and std columns (plus Activity and Subject) to meanAndStdCols
Extracts a new data.frame (called meanAndStdData) with only those columns from meanAndStdCols.
Summarizes meanAndStdData calculating the average for each column for each activity/subject pair to DATA_ALL.
Transforms the column Activity into a factor.
Uses activityLabels to name levels of Activity factor.


Writing final data to txt
Writes tidy_data data frame to the ouputfile.
