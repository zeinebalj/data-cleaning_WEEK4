# data-cleaning_WEEK4
Introduction

This repo contains my course project to Coursera "Getting And Cleaning Data" course that is part of Data Science specialization.

There is just one script called run_analysis.R. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

Download UCI HAR zip file to data dir
Read data
Do some transformations
Write output data to a txt file 
The CodeBook.md explains it more detailed.

Run from command line

Clone this repo

Run the script:

$ Rscript run_analysis.R

Look for the final dataset :

tidy_data.txt
